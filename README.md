- [Copy-on-write for ext2](https://github.com/majeski/ZSO/tree/master/ext2_cow)
> Patch for Linux kernel 4.1.18 with copy-on-write for the ext2 filesystem. It operates on a block level without changing inode memory layout.
> The patch comes with analogous to cp program **ccp** which instead of copying creates a file that shares blocks with a source file.

- [Vintage2D driver](https://github.com/majeski/ZSO/tree/master/vintage2d)
> Driver for simplified graphics card. It supports multiple contexts, memory mapping a context, synchronous and asynchronous commands.

- [Raise](https://github.com/majeski/ZSO/tree/master/raise)
> A tool for bringing back programs from core files. The general idea is to restore memory state and jump to the appropriate line of code.
